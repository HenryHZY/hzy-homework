①An assembly (or assembler) language,often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.


②A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program.

③In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state.

④In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

⑤Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call.
